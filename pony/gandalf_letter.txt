“THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. 

Midyear's Day, Shire Year, 1418.

Dear Frodo,
Bad news has reached me here. 
I must go off at once. You had better leave Bag End soon, and get out of the Shire before the end of July at latest. 
I will return as soon as I can; and I will follow you, if I find that you are gone. 
Leave a message for me here, if you pass through Bree. You can trust the landlord (Butterbur). 
You may meet a friend of mine on the Road: a Man, lean, dark, tall, by some called Strider. 
He knows our business and will help you. Make for Rivendel. There I hope we may meet again. 
If I do not come, Elrond will advise you.
Yours in haste
GANDALF. 
PS. Do NOT use It again, not far any reason whatever! Do not travel by night! ”
“PPS. Make sure that it is the real Strider. There are many strange men on the roads. His true name is Aragorn.”
