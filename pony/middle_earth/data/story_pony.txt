Welcome to The Prancing Pony.

Your group have just managed to escape from the Black Riders.
Now it is time to get more information about Strider.

There's a lonely guy sitting there and the owner of the inn.
By Gandalf's instructions you suppose he could be Strider, but you still know nothing about him

Your other option is talk with the owner.
Choose with who you'll talk first...

Remember you always have the command 'helpme' available if you run out of ideas
