Your mission  will be to find "The Prancing Pony" and start a talk with its owner, Barliman Butterbur.

As you may expect, the inn is represented by a container you should find among the running ones.
Remember that command 'docker ps' shows all the containers running in docker.
After you find the container, you can try accessing its filesystem with the following command:

docker exec -it <container id or name> /bin/bash 

When inside the container, you will have to find Barliman Butterbur who will tell the next step for your mission.

If needed, the command 'helpme' will also be available inside "The Prancing Pony"
