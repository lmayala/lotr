Welcome to Middle Earth

Bilbo celebrates his eleventy-first birthday and leaves the Shire suddenly, passing the Ring to Frodo Baggins, 
his cousin[c] and heir.

Gandalf, the wizard, suspects that the ring is one of the Rings of Power.

After Bilbo's birthday Frodo set out on foot carrying the ring in his journey with the company of Sam, Merry and Pippin, 
but soon after they leave they start being pursued by the misterious Black Riders.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will be to escape from the riders, 
reach the village of Bree and find there a strange called Strider.
