After escaping from the Black Riders, the hobbits reach the village of Bree.
The home and centre of the art is thus to be found in the old inn of Bree, "The Prancing Pony", 
that has been kept by the family of Butterbur from time beyond record.

Soonly after entering The Prancing Pony, Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten man, 
sitting in the shadows near the wall, was listening intently to the hobbit-talk.

Asked by Frodo, Barliman Butterbur told that he was one of the called by them "wandering folk -Rangers" who was known as Strider.
