Black Riders are represented by containers hidden behind specific ports. 

As in the the story, there are 9 riders pursuing the Hobbits
Before trying to escape from them, you will need to identify where they are.

Each of the containers is listening on a specific port, so you will need to identify those ports.
You can use the real name for the riders that is 'Nazgúl' for guessing which of the containers running corresponds to a Nazgúl

=== TIPS ===

Docker commands and tips you may need for this step:

- 'docker ps' for showing all the containers running in Docker
- remember that whenever a container listens on a specific port you can map that port to the same or to another port in the machine where the container runs
  This is seen as <port1>-><port2> when you run 'docker ps' where 'port1' is the host port reachable from the outside and port2 is the container port.
  In our environment, all Nazgûls containers run on port 5678, but each of them is mapped into a port 600x. 
  For reaching the content of each container you should use a web URL of the form http://localhost:600x


=== WARNING ===

Due to the way docker is installed, all commands must be preceeded by 'sudo'
So, whenever this help says 'docker ps' you should execute 'sudo docker ps'


=== WARNING2 ===

When playing you're not allowed to run destructive docker commands (even with 'sudo') on containers whose names do not start with your username
If you username is 'test', you'll be able to run 'sudo docker rm test_mycontainer' but not 'sudo docker rm otheruser_containers'

It would be a good practice to add your username before any image or container you create so you'll be able to manage it


=== GOAL ===

All Nazgûls' containers could be reached through http and they will respond with the name of the Nazgûl there.
For getting the name through console you have two alternatives:
  - Using curl: 'curl http://localhost:<mapped_port>'
  - Using a text web browser called 'Lynx': 'lynx http://localhost:<mapped_port>'

Once you get the ports you will have to create a list with the nine ports and Nazgûl names in a text file where each port:name should be in a single line.
Final format for the file should be:

port1:name_for_nazgûl_1
port2:name_for_nazgûl_2
...


IMPORTANT: The name provided in the file should not be the container name, but the one shown by the web client (whichever you decided to use).

TIP: There are some text editors installed you can use for creating the file:

   - vim  - the traditional Linux editor. Powerful but a bit tricky if you're not used to it
   - nano - limited but easier to use
   * jed  - Similar to Windows's 'edit' is the recommended one. It has a menu you can trigger with F10 so it would be even easier that Nano.

=== HOW TO FINISH THE STAGE ===

After you finish creating the file, you can call the command 'find_riders' followed by your file name.
Eg. If your file is called 'nazgul.txt' you should run 'find_riders nazgul.txt'
You will receive a message with the results and if you were able to identify where the Nazgúls are, also the instructions to your next step.

Whenever you need to go back to this instructions, command 'helpme' will show this same text.
