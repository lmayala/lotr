Frodo has been hurt and taken to Rivendel by the rest of the fellowship

Your mission now is to build the environment for Elrond half-elven to cure him.

As you may imagine we\'ll need to create another container, but this time the task is not just running an existing image.
You will need to create a Dockerfile based on nginx image in Docker Hub.

Basically, you just need to override index.html file inside the container.
For that, create an index.html file with the content specified below and copy it over the default index.html inside the nginx image.


=== Content required for index.html ===

Healer: Elrond half-elven
Healed: Frodo Baggins
Place: Rivendel


Your content should run at port $RIVENDEL_PORT

=== TIPS ===

Standard folder for nginx index file is /usr/share/nginx/html and there is where you need to copy your own index.html
Your index.html does not need to have any html code, so it could be only plain text

=== FINISHING THE STAGE ===

For finishing the stage, run the command 'heal_frodo' that will validate the container exists and has the right data.
You will receive a message with your results
