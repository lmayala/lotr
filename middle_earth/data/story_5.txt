A KNIFE IN THE DARK

Strider and the hobbits decided to camp, feeling that they are again followed by the Nazg√ªl's shadows.

They strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. 
Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly advanced.

At some point terror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they threw themselves flat on the ground. 
Frodo was hardly less terrified but his terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the Ring. 
He did not forget the Barrow, nor the message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings

He felt Sam looking at him, as if he knew that his master was in some great trouble, but he could not turn towards him. 
He shut his eyes and struggled for a while; but resistance became unbearable, and at last he slowly drew out the chain, 
and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of his left hand.

Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and dark, the shapes became terribly clear. 
There were five tall figures: two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing, all of them with their swords of steel.

Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they rushed towards him. Desperate, he drew his own sword. 
Two of the figures halted. The third was taller than the others: his hair was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown. 
In one hand he held a long sword, and in the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light. 

He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo. At that moment Frodo threw himself forward on the ground. 
At the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy. 
A shrill cry rang out in the night; and he felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder.
